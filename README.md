Since I am interested to learn new human and programming languages, why not code a game about languages? 

This is a type-based game to learn and memorize words in Filipino, German, Korean, and of course, English. Enable korean keyboard in [Windows](https://www.koreanfluent.com/cross_cultural/korean_keyboard/korean-keyboard-windows-7.htm), [Mac OS](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/korean-input-method/welcome/mac), or [Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1483991/type-korean-on-ubuntu-directions-for-2023). To view the backend repository, click [here](https://github.com/stephenstrange-blip/graphql_backend)

For support of additional languages or you want to include more words to the database, feel free to contact me through through mail or my socials.
